          Until recently, I lived abroad and taught English to adults, a career I enjoyed but couldn't sustain due to the seasonal nature of the work. In order to supplement my income, I turned to the plethora of online teaching platforms available. Seeing first-hand how technology is changing ESL teaching, I was inspired by all of the possibilities. Technology has the power to increase access to education, and I want to contribute to that continuing expansion.

        Despite dabbling in different programming languages and tutorials over the years, I always thought this field was out of reach for an English major like myself. However, in my programming journey so far, I’ve found that my strengths lay in learning things quickly and clearly communicating difficult concepts - skills honed in my previous work experience. I’ve discovered that I enjoy both front-end and back-end work, and I get really excited about writing good tests.

          Though I’ve an interest and background in education, I’m also eager to learn more about other niches. I recently discovered that I’m fascinated by augmented writing, which I didn’t previously know existed. What I find most exciting about my new career path is having a platform for bringing my existing passions to life and discovering new ones.
